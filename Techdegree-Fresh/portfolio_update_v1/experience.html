I have worked a countless number of jobs and I would love to use my life experiences to help me make great websites! Some of the jobs I have done include, opera singer, salesman, lifeguard, bouncer, assistant researcher, video rental clerk and gardener. Creating websites is going to be an extremely exciting challenge!
